/* D1_4 Change data capture and history, told on one evolving board (engine: story.js), one idea per board.
   The running example is customer 100898, the only customer in September's feed that arrival order gets wrong. Khalid
   (107371, from the course introduction) signs up during September, and customer 100710 is erased.
   Hard ideas are built step by step: neighbouring boards share a heading, and each click adds one piece.
   Every row and number is real: data/raw/cdc (the 1 September snapshot and September's change feed), app.customers and
   app.orders in data/raw/qafila_oltp.sqlite, and Lab 1.4's solution (labs/solutions/D1_4_cdc_merge_scd.ipynb).
   Feed times are UTC, as the feed records them. Mobile numbers are masked on the board. */
