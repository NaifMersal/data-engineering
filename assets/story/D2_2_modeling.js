/* D2_2 Dimensional modeling, told on one evolving board (engine: story.js), one idea per board.
   The running example is Khalid's order 5043883 from the course introduction (00_intro.js): two lines and a 9 SAR fee.
   Hard ideas are built step by step: neighbouring boards share a heading, and each click adds one piece.
   Every row and number is real: data/raw/qafila_oltp.sqlite, api/payments.jsonl, events/delivery_events.jsonl and the
   star schema Lab 2.2's solution builds (labs/solutions/D2_2_dimensional_modeling.ipynb). Only the stock levels are illustrative. */
