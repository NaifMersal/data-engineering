# # SQL window functions, from first principles
#
# Before Day 1 · self-paced · about 60 min. Labs 1.4, 2.1, 3.4 and the capstone lean on window functions: remove
# duplicate events, keep the latest event per key, find out from when to when something was true. This walkthrough
# builds them up from nothing, on tables small enough to check by eye.
#
# 🤔 asks you to predict before you run a cell · 🔍 says what the output means · ▶ cells play a window function back
# step by step.
#
# **Contents**
# - [ ] 1 · `GROUP BY` collapses rows, `OVER` keeps them
# - [ ] 2 · `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY`: each row's window
# - [ ] 3 · Ranking: `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, ties, deduplication
# - [ ] 4 · `LAG` and `LEAD`: looking at the neighbours
# - [ ] 5 · Frames: "everything before me"
# - [ ] 6 · Evaluation order: why `WHERE` can't, and `QUALIFY` can
# - [ ] 7 · A customer's city history: by hand, then in SQL; break it on purpose
# - [ ] 8 · The same ideas on real data: courier events

# ## 3 · Ranking: `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, ties, deduplication
#
# Ranking functions take no argument: they number the rows of each partition in the `ORDER BY` of the window.
#
# 🤔 **Predict** · Customer 101 has two events with `lsn` 22 (the redelivery). Ordered by `lsn DESC`, what do
# `row_number`, `rank` and `dense_rank` give those two rows, and the next one?

# %% [markdown]
# 🔍 `row_number` always gives 1, 2, 3...: on a **tie** it breaks it arbitrarily, so which copy gets 1 can change from run
# to run. `rank` gives ties the same number and skips (1, 1, 3); `dense_rank` doesn't skip (1, 1, 2). `WINDOW w AS (...)`
# names a window so several functions can share it.
#
# Harmless here, because the two copies are identical. When tied rows **differ**, "the latest row" is a coin flip: add a
# tie-breaker to the `ORDER BY` (`lsn DESC, arrival DESC`), or deduplicate first.
#
# Deduplication is itself a ranking problem: number the copies of each `lsn` and keep copy 1. Filtering on a window
# result needs a subquery here (§6 shows a shortcut). The rest of the walkthrough reads this `dedup` view:

# ## 4 · `LAG` and `LEAD`: looking at the neighbours
#
# `lag(x)` reads `x` from the **previous** row of the window, `lead(x)` from the **next** one. At the edges of a
# partition there is no neighbour, so you get `NULL` (or a default: `lag(x, 1, 'none')`).

# The **frame** says which rows of the partition an aggregate sees, relative to the current row:

# `n FOLLOWING` or `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`. (Ranking functions and `lag`/`lead` ignore frames.)

# To **see** a frame, aggregate with `list(order_id)`: it collects the ids of exactly the rows `sum` or `max` would see
# with the same `OVER (...)`.

# 🔍 The late `lsn` 18 (Riyadh) is treated as the newest change: customer 101 "moves back" to Riyadh **after** Jeddah,
# the Jeddah period ends before it starts, Dammam's period overlaps the Riyadh one (two cities at once), and the
# current city is wrong. An older edit applied after a newer one is called **state regression**; ordering by `lsn` is
# the fix.
#
# 🧪 **D · Skip the deduplication.** What appears for customer 101?

# 🔍 Two Jeddah rows: the first is valid from 08:00 **to** 08:00, a zero-length period that double-counts in some joins
# and breaks uniqueness tests (Day 2).
#
# This history table has a name: Day 1's last session calls it **SCD Type 2** (a *slowly changing dimension* that keeps
# every period) and builds it for every Qafila customer in Lab 1.4, with the pieces you just used: dedup by `lsn`, latest
# per key with `QUALIFY`, periods with `lead`, deletes dropped after the window, out-of-order detection with a frame.

# ## 8 · The same ideas on real data: courier events
#
# The courier app sends one event per delivery step: `assigned → picked_up → out_for_delivery → delivered` (or
# `cancelled`, or `failed`). The events include redelivered ones (same `event_id`, sent twice) and late arrivals.
# `event_ts` is when the step happened, in UTC; `ingest_time` is when the event arrived.

# |---|---|
# | **It does** | an aggregate or a neighbour's value next to every row, without collapsing rows or a self-join · rank, dedupe and keep the latest per key · running totals and "everything before me" |
# | **It doesn't** | filter in `WHERE` (windows run after it: use `QUALIFY` or a subquery) · break ties for you (`row_number` on a tie is arbitrary) · see other partitions |
# | **In this course** | dedup, latest state and city history (SCD Type 2) from the customer edits (Lab 1.4) · Polars' `.over()` (Lab 2.1) · latest state per key in streaming (Lab 3.4) |
# | **In other engines** | the same `OVER (...)` in PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, Spark SQL and Databricks; `QUALIFY` everywhere except PostgreSQL |
#
# **Cheat sheet**
#
# | Code | Does |
# |---|---|
# | `f(x) OVER (PARTITION BY k)` | the group's answer on every row of the group |
# | `... OVER (PARTITION BY k ORDER BY t)` | a running answer: from the start of the partition up to the row (and its peers) |
# | `row_number()`, `rank()`, `dense_rank()` | 1, 2, 3 · 1, 1, 3 · 1, 1, 2 on a tie |
# | `QUALIFY row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY k ORDER BY t DESC) = 1` | the latest row per key; `PARTITION BY id` keeps one copy per id |
# | `lag(x)`, `lead(x)`, `lag(x, 1, default)` | the previous / next row's value, `NULL` at the edges |
# | `lead(changed_at) OVER (PARTITION BY k ORDER BY lsn)` | when a period ends: its `valid_to` |
# | `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING` | everything before me |
# | `ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING` | my neighbours and me |
# | `WINDOW w AS (...)`, then `OVER w` | one window shared by several functions |
#
# ## Checkpoint
#
# 1. In one sentence each: what does `PARTITION BY` decide, what does the `ORDER BY` inside `OVER` decide, and what does
#    the frame decide?
# 2. Why is `row_number() ... = 1` dangerous on tied rows that differ, and what are two ways to make it safe?
# 3. Why must the delete rows be removed **after** `lead`, and which clause does that?
# 4. Your history query runs twice on the same edits. Why is the result identical, and which line makes it so?
#
