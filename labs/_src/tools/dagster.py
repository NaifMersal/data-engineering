# # Dagster, assets on a schedule
#
# Day 4, before Lab 4.1 · CPU only. Every lab so far ran its steps by hand. In production a nightly script runs them,
# until it fails halfway, runs twice or lets a bad file through. You'll write that script, watch it break, then
# declare the same pipeline as **Dagster assets**: the tables you want, what each is built from, and the checks it
# must pass.
#
# **The data:** three stores and one orders file per day from the stores app, invented and small enough to check by
# eye. Lab 4.1 orchestrates the real warehouse.
#
# 🤔 asks you to predict before you run a cell · 🔍 says what the output means · ➕ sections are for your own pace.
#
# **Contents**
# - [ ] 1 · The problem: a nightly script

# - [ ] 11 · Summary

# %% [markdown] 🎓
# 🎓 **Instructor notes** (instructor copy only)
#
# - Core ≈ 27': §1 3' · §2 2' · §3 2' · §4 4' · §5 3' (the hand edit ➕) · §7 4' (the append re-run ➕) · §8 4' ·
#   §9 1' (the schedule; the sensor and retries ➕) · §10 3' · §11 1'. §6 is ➕.
# - Sections 1–4 and 8 carry the session: the script breaking, the graph, selection, and a blocking check. §10
#   bridges to Lab 4.1, whose task 2 puts the real dbt project in the graph.
# - In class, run the cells of a ➕ part without stopping on them: later cells may use what they build (the
#   summary's `Definitions` uses §6's resource and §9's sensor).
# - Don't write Lab 4.1's code here: its exercises are the delete-then-insert partition, the duplicate-events check
#   and the supplier-file sensor with `run_key`. This notebook uses an upsert, a negative-amount check and a cursor.
# - Expect "Airflow?": the most deployed orchestrator. Airflow 3 added assets too, but its unit is still the task;
#   in Dagster the unit is the asset. The ideas here (dependencies, partitions, idempotency, checks) transfer.
# - Everything runs in-process with `dg.materialize`: no server. If there's time, show `dagster dev` on the capstone
#   pipeline (`labs/capstone/`) for the UI: the same graph, runs and checks.

# ## 9 · When runs start: schedules, sensors, retries
#
# Until now we called `materialize` by hand. A deployed Dagster has a **daemon** that starts runs on a **schedule**
# (a clock) or from a **sensor** (something happened), while a **retry policy** decides what happens when a step
# fails. Each can be tested by evaluating one "tick" yourself.
#
# First a schedule for the partitioned load: every night at 01:30, Riyadh time (the timezone of `DAYS`), load
# **yesterday's** partition.

# %%

tick = nightly_schedule.evaluate_tick(dg.build_schedule_context(scheduled_execution_time=tick_time))
print("tick at", tick_time, "→ runs partition", [r.partition_key for r in tick.run_requests])

# %% [markdown]
# 🔍 The 01:30 tick on Wednesday asks for Tuesday's partition, the day that just ended. A missed night can be re-run
# as that partition, not as "today".
#
# ➕ A file doesn't always arrive at 01:30. A **sensor** is a function the daemon calls every 30 seconds or so; it
# returns the runs to start. Between ticks it keeps a **cursor**, a string it writes and gets back next time. This one
# requests one run per file whose name sorts after the cursor (file names sort by date).

# process a file twice.
#
# ➕ Some failures are worth retrying (an API's 429 "too many requests", a timeout), most are not (a bug, a bad file).

# | **It does** | a graph of assets from the code · runs a selection in order · records every materialization with metadata · resources for dev and prod · partitions and backfills · asset checks, blocking or not · schedules, sensors, retries · dbt models and tests in the same graph · a UI for all of it |
# | **It doesn't** | move or transform data itself (your SQL, dlt, dbt, Polars do) · make an asset idempotent (you do, §7) · know about changes made outside it (§5) |
# | **In this course** | Lab 4.1 orchestrates the real warehouse: a loader and the Qafila dbt project in one graph, a partitioned backfill, a blocking check, a schedule and a sensor · the capstone's `pipeline.py`, one code location from the sources to the gold table |
# | **As a service** | Dagster+ · Airflow as a service: Astronomer, Amazon MWAA, Google Cloud Composer · built into platforms: Databricks Workflows, Snowflake tasks, dbt platform jobs, Fabric pipelines |

# **Cheat sheet**
#
# | Code | Does |
# |---|---|
# | `@dg.asset(key=[...], deps=[...], group_name=..., kinds={...})` | an asset; `deps` are what it's built from |
# | `def b(a): ...` | `b` is built from `a`, and gets `a`'s value (IO manager) |
# | `return dg.MaterializeResult(metadata={...})` | record facts about this materialization |
# | `dg.materialize(assets, selection=..., partition_key=..., resources=...)` | run in this process |
# | `dg.AssetSelection.assets(a).downstream()` / `.upstream()` | a and what's built from it / what it's built from |
# | `instance.get_latest_materialization_event(key)` | when, by which run, with what metadata |
# | `class R(dg.ConfigurableResource)` + an argument `r: R` | a resource, chosen per run; secrets via `dg.EnvVar(...)` |
# | `dg.DailyPartitionsDefinition(start_date=...)` + `context.partition_key` | one run per day; make it idempotent |
# | `@dg.asset_check(asset=a, blocking=True)` → `dg.AssetCheckResult(passed=...)` | a check; blocking stops downstream |
# | `dg.define_asset_job(name, selection=...)` | a named selection, for schedules and sensors |
# | `dg.build_schedule_from_partitioned_job(job, hour_of_day=1)` | nightly run of yesterday's partition |
# | `@dg.sensor(job=...)`, `context.cursor`, `dg.RunRequest(run_key=...)` | runs when something happens, at most once per key |
# | `dg.RetryPolicy(max_retries=3, delay=1, backoff=dg.Backoff.EXPONENTIAL)` | retry a failed step, waiting longer each time |
# | `@dbt_assets(manifest=...)` + `dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()` | dbt models as assets, tests as checks |
# | `dg.Definitions(assets=..., asset_checks=..., jobs=..., schedules=..., sensors=..., resources=...)` | one code location; `dagster dev` serves the UI on it |

# ## Checkpoint
#
# 1. The script's morning re-run doubled Tuesday. Which two things in §4 and §7 stop that from happening?
# 2. `store_ranking` was stale in §5. How did Dagster know, and why couldn't the script?
# 3. A blocking check failed. What do the skipped assets contain now?
# 4. The supplier files arrive "sometime on Monday". Schedule or sensor? And what makes the sensor safe to tick every
#    30 seconds?
