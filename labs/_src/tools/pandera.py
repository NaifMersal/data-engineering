# # Pandera, checks at the door
#
# Day 2, before Lab 2.4, after `tools/dbt` §9 (dbt tests) · CPU only. A payment provider sends Qafila a day of
# payments. You check it with hand-written asserts, watch what they miss, then write the same rules once as a
# **Pandera schema**: every problem at once, row by row, and the bad rows set aside while the good ones go on.
#
# **The data:** eight invented payments (SAR) with six problems hidden in them, few enough to check by eye. The last
# section runs the same kind of schema on the real payments feed.
#
# 🤔 asks you to predict before you run a cell · 🔍 says what the output means · ➕ sections are for your own pace.
#

# 🎓 **Instructor notes** (instructor copy only)
#
# - D2_4 opens with `tools/dbt` §9 (10'), then this walkthrough. Core ≈ 16': §1 2' · §2 1' · §3 1' · §4 2' · §5 3' ·
#   §6 2' · §7 2' · §8 2' · §10 1'. §9 is ➕. §8 links the two halves of the session: the same rules, at the door
#   (Pandera) and in the warehouse (dbt).
# - §5 to §7 each build what the next one uses (`Payment`, `failures2`, `clean`): run them in order.
# - In class, run the cells of a ➕ section without stopping on them: later cells may use what they build.
# - Lab 2.4 task 5 asks for the `SupplierPrice` model and gives the quarantine code: here the same mechanism runs on
#   payments, so don't write the supplier schema in class.
# - Expect "why not Great Expectations / Soda?": same job (declared expectations, a report). Pandera is a library that
#   lives in the pipeline's Python, next to the DataFrame; the others add their own config, stores and reports.
#   Pydantic checks one record at a time (an API payload), not a DataFrame.

#
# The usual first version: a function with a few asserts, run before the load.


# %%

# %% [markdown]
# 🔍 It stops at the first problem, without saying which payment, or how many other problems there are.
#
# 🤔 **Predict** · Someone removes the duplicate and the negative amount. What does the check say about the six rows
# that are left?

# `(amount > 0).all()` skips nulls. And the refund recorded **before** its capture (9002)? No check even looks.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 2 · The mental model: a schema, a validation, a report
#
# ```
#   schema (a class)                      validate(df)                    result
#   column: type, nullable,     ───►  1. columns there? types right?  ───►  the same DataFrame      (all good)
#           checks (gt, isin…)        2. each column's checks              SchemaError            (first failure)
#   frame:  checks across columns     3. the frame's checks                SchemaErrors + report  (lazy=True: all)
# ```
#
# Validation doesn't change the data. It either hands it back or raises, with a report of what failed.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 3 · A first schema
#
# A schema is a class: one attribute per column, its type, and its checks.

# %%
class Hello(pa.DataFrameModel):
    payment_id: int
    amount: float = pa.Field(gt=0)


good = PAYMENTS.head(3).select("payment_id", "amount")
Hello.validate(good)

# %% [markdown]
# 🔍 `validate` returns the DataFrame, so it fits in a chain: `Hello.validate(df).write_parquet(...)`.
#
# 🤔 **Predict** · And the full export, with its negative and missing amounts?

# %%
try:
    Hello.validate(PAYMENTS)
except pa.errors.SchemaError as e:
    print("❌", type(e).__name__, "·", str(e).splitlines()[0])

# %% [markdown]
# 🔍 It reports the `null` and stops: one error at a time, like the asserts. §5 asks for all of them.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 4 · Types and nulls, before any rule
#
# Each column is checked in this order: is it there, is its **type** right, are there **nulls**, then its checks.
# Files often arrive as text: here is the export read from a CSV, every column a string.

# %%
PAYMENTS.write_csv(OUT / "payments_2026-09-14.csv")

try:
    Hello.validate(as_text)
except pa.errors.SchemaError as e:
    print("❌", str(e).splitlines()[0])

# %% [markdown]
# 🔍 Pandera doesn't guess: a `String` column is not an `int` column. Either parse the file yourself (Lab 2.4 must,
# because its supplier writes `9,49`), or ask Pandera to **coerce** each column to the declared type.

# %%
class HelloCoerced(pa.DataFrameModel):
    payment_id: int
    amount: float = pa.Field(gt=0, nullable=True)

    class Config:
        coerce = True


HelloCoerced.validate(as_text.head(3)).schema

# %% [markdown]
# 🤔 **Predict** · `HelloCoerced` allows nulls in `amount`. Does the full CSV pass now?

# %%
try:
    HelloCoerced.validate(as_text)
except pa.errors.SchemaError as e:
    print("❌", str(e).splitlines()[0])

# %% [markdown]
# 🔍 The null is allowed now, so the next problem shows: `-5.0` breaks `gt=0`. Without `nullable=True`, a null fails.
# dbt is the other way round: a column may be null until you add a `not_null` test. Pandera's default is the one that
# would have caught 9007.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 5 · Built-in checks, and every failure at once
#
# Finance wants every problem in one report, to send back to the provider. `validate(df, lazy=True)` runs **every**
# check and raises `SchemaErrors` (plural) with a table of failures. Here is the full schema, `Payment`:

# %%
class Payment(pa.DataFrameModel):
    payment_id: int = pa.Field(unique=True)
    order_id: int
    amount: float = pa.Field(gt=0)
    method: str = pa.Field(isin=["card", "wallet", "cash"])
    status: str = pa.Field(isin=["captured", "refunded", "failed"])


failures = None
try:
    Payment.validate(PAYMENTS, lazy=True)
except pa.errors.SchemaErrors as e:
    failures = e.failure_cases
failures

# %% [markdown]
# | Check | Fails when |
# |---|---|
# | `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le`, `in_range` | a value is outside the bounds |
# | `isin`, `notin` | a value is not in (or is in) a list |
# | `str_startswith`, `str_matches`, `str_length` | a string has the wrong shape |
# | `unique=True` | a value appears more than once |
# | `nullable=True` | (allows nulls; the default rejects them) |
#
# 🔍 Six failures: both copies of 9003, the negative, the null, `cheque` and `Card`, each with its row number (`index`,
# from 0). A report you can send back to the provider. Still missing: the refund before its capture (9002), because no
# check compares two columns yet.
#
# **Break it on purpose.** Pipelines often work on a `LazyFrame` (Polars' plan, not yet run). `lazy=True` above is a
# Pandera option; a `LazyFrame` is something else.
#
# 🤔 **Predict** · We validate `PAYMENTS.lazy()`. Does the negative amount fail?

# %%
checked = Payment.validate(PAYMENTS.lazy())
print(type(checked).__name__, "· no error raised")

# %% [markdown]
# 🔍 No error. On a `LazyFrame`, Pandera checks only what it can without running the plan: the columns and their
# types. The **values** are never looked at. To check them, validate a `DataFrame`: call `.collect()` first.

# %%
try:
    Payment.validate(PAYMENTS.lazy().collect())

# %% [markdown]
# ## 6 · Your own checks: one column, or the whole row
#
# Some rules aren't built in: an amount must be a whole number of halalas. A **column check** receives the column and
# returns one `True`/`False` per row.

# %%
class PaymentChecked(Payment):                           # every rule of Payment, plus one

# %% [markdown]

# %% [markdown]
# ## 7 · Quarantine: good rows on, bad rows aside
#
# Rejecting the whole file for one bad row leaves Finance with no payments to reconcile; loading it all lets the bad
# rows in. The middle way is **quarantine**: valid rows go on, invalid rows go aside with the reason, and someone (the
# provider, the data owner) is told. Number the rows as the failure table does, then split.

# %%
numbered = PAYMENTS.with_row_index("index").with_columns(pl.col("index").cast(pl.Int32))

quarantine = numbered.join(reasons, on="index", how="inner")                # the bad rows, with their reason
clean = numbered.join(reasons, on="index", how="anti").drop("index")        # every other row
quarantine.select("index", "payment_id", "amount", "method", "reason").sort("index")

# %%
U.check(clean["payment_id"].to_list() == [9001], "only 9001 passes every rule")

clean.write_parquet(OUT / "payments_clean.parquet")
quarantine.write_csv(OUT / "payments_quarantine.csv")
print("written:", sorted(p.name for p in OUT.iterdir()))

# %% [markdown]
# 🔍 Both copies of 9003 went to quarantine: `unique` flags every copy, because Pandera can't know which one is right.
# If "keep the first" is the rule, deduplicate **before** validating and say so in the code. Lab 2.4 runs this same
# split on the supplier price files.

# %% [markdown] 🎓
# 🎓 Ask: "who reads `payments_quarantine.csv`?" If nobody owns it, quarantine is a slow way to lose data. Day 4's
# observability session counts quarantined rows as one of the signals to alert on.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 8 · Pandera and dbt tests: where each rule belongs
#
# The dbt tests you just met check the same kinds of rules, written another way:
#
# | Rule | Pandera (Python, on a DataFrame) | dbt (SQL, on a warehouse table) |
# |---|---|---|
# | an id is unique | `pa.Field(unique=True)` | `data_tests: [unique]` |
# | a value is present | the default (`nullable=False`) | `not_null` (nullable is the default) |
# | one of a list | `pa.Field(isin=[...])` | `accepted_values` |
# | positive | `pa.Field(gt=0)` | the project's generic test `positive` |
# | across columns | `@pa.dataframe_check` | a singular test: a `SELECT` of the bad rows in `tests/` |
# | points to another table | `isin=known_ids`, or a custom check | `relationships` |
#
# And where each one runs:
#
# | | Pandera | dbt tests |
# |---|---|---|
# | **When** | before the load, on each file or batch | after each model is built, on the whole table |
# | **Where** | in the pipeline's Python (dlt, Dagster, a script) | in the warehouse, as SQL |
# | **On failure** | raise, or quarantine the bad rows | `warn`, or `error` and skip everything downstream |
# | **Best for** | data you **receive**: files, API batches, uploads | data you **build**: models, joins, aggregates |
#
# Neither replaces the other. Check what arrives at the door, test what you build inside, and write down with the
# producer what they promise to send (a **data contract**, Lab 4.2).
#
# Inside the pipeline, Pandera can also guard a function: `@pa.check_types` validates every argument and return value
# annotated with a schema, so unchecked data can't get in.

# September, and hundreds of wallet payments created after it have none. Which timestamp a rule uses is part of the

#
# ## Checkpoint
#
# 1. The asserts in §1 passed a payment with no amount. Why, and which Pandera default catches it?
# 2. `lazy=True` and a `LazyFrame`: what does each do to a validation?
# 3. Both copies of 9003 were quarantined. When is that right, and what would you do instead?
# 4. One check fails on 3 rows of a file; another fails on thousands. Reject the file, quarantine the rows, or load it
#    all and warn? Is the data wrong, or the rule? Who decides?
